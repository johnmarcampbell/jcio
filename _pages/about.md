Data Scientist and computational nuclear physics PhD with 8+ years experience in statistical modeling, machine learning, experimental design, productionalizing predictive models, processing terabyte-scale data sets with billions of records, opti-mizing processing pipelines for distributed computing, and communicating technical concepts to non-technical audiences.  

# Experience  
---  
### Senior Data Scientist - Afiniti  
**Dec 2018 -- Present**  
 * Develop, maintain, and deploy models that serve 3M+ monthly active users  
 * Increase customer retention for a national telecommunications company, increasing revenue by \$102M/year.  
 * Reduced subscription cancellations for a well-known satellite radio vendor by 2.5%, generating a projected $16M/year in increased revenue.  
 * Developed AI-driven task-assignment system for a pharmacy which increased productivity by 12% and allowed staffing to be reduced by 48 FTE, saving $1.4M/year.  
 * Manage small teams of data scientists, and coordinate support personnel like business analysts and ETL engineers.  
 * Work with client-facing teams to develop business insights that inform contract negotiations.  

### Data Science Fellow - The Data Incubator  
**Sep 2018 -- Nov 2018**  
 * Selected as one of 30 Fellows from a pool of over 3,000 applicants.  
 * Developed an unsupervised document classifier to characterize 23 years of congressional speeches (140 million words).  
 * Wrote a custom web scraper to download and parse 560k web pages; implemented a heuristic matching engine to annotate resulting unstructured text.  

### Graduate Research Assistant - Ohio State University  
**Feb 2012 -- Apr 2018**  
 * Performed experimental nuclear physics research funded by the National Science Foundation to study nuclear matter under extreme conditions.  
 * Analyzed 11 TB of data describing collisions between atomic nuclei.  
 * Used nonlinear multivariate regression to probe the shape of ultra-microscopic systems. Implemented Monte Carlo techniques to generate synthetic data to understand background signatures.  
 * Designed custom data structures which reduced the size-on-disk of our data by 90%.  
 * Regularly led teams of 4 to 6 scientists in extended periods of fast-paced data collection (20 TB/day) where prolonged downtime was unacceptable.
